# Hollywood Unveiled: Rewriting Women's Stories on the Silver Screen

**--> A 150 word description of the project idea and goals. What’s the motivation behind your project? What story would you like to tell, and why?**  
The perception and role of women in the US society has greatly evolved during the past centuries. Indeed, between the beginning of the 20th century and the beginning of the 21st century,
women acquired a lot of rights and became more important. Women can now vote, work without the approval of their husband and some are even leading big companies, such as Mary Barra leading General Motors. 
Everyday, women are fighting for their rights and to be as equal as men. But what about women's portrayal in the entertainment industry? Has this evolved at the same time as women gained more rights or does it remain just as stereotypical as before? 
Simply put, is the entertainment industry a mirror of women's evolution in society?

## Research questions
**--> Research Questions: A list of research questions you would like to address during the project.**  
How has the proportion of female actors in movies evolved over time? 
Is the movie industry giving more important and leading roles to women? Do they have their own storylines or are just love interests?
What types of adjectives are used in synopsis when describing women and to which character personas are women mostly attributed?
Which movie genres are more affected?
Do higher-grossing movies rely more on gender stereotypes than others?
This information will enable us to understand how gender stereotypes in movies fluctuate with time and whether this representation is affected by major women’s rights events in the US (e.g. right to vote, etc. found on Wikipedia). 

## Additional datasets
**--> Proposed additional datasets (if any): List the additional dataset(s) you want to use (if any), and some ideas on how you expect to get, manage, process, and enrich it/them. Show us that you’ve read the docs and some examples, and that you have a clear idea on what to expect. Discuss data size and format if relevant. It is your responsibility to check that what you propose is feasible.**
